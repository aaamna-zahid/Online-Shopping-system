This console-based project simulates an e-commerce platform with user authentication, product browsing, and cart management. Users can register, log in, and shop across categories (Men, Women, Kids), while admins can view transactions. Features include tiered discounts (Silver/Gold/Diamond customers), file-based data storage, and OOP concepts like inheritance and polymorphism. Built entirely in C++, it demonstrates core programming principles in a practical retail system.
